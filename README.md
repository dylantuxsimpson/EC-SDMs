Data and code for analyses in Simpson et al. 2019 (Landscape Ecology)

Included here are the data files and R code used in our analyses of *Ehrlichia chaffeensis* prevalence and *Amblyomma americanum* occupancy dynamics. 

If all is as it should be, one should be able to simply clone this repo and run the code as it is. File paths should be intact.
